## Notes to Self:

inbox/scratchpad/processing -- how do I want to handle this?
next actions
waiting for
projects (with notes, tasks, etc)
contexts (tags?)
someday/maybe -- status for both tasks and projects that kicks them to different lists (can be moved to current)
user authentication... I need to figure this part out. logins, password hashing, browser tokens/cookies, etc

calendar and reminders -- build these last?
